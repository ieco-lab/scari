# Description


## How to clone this project locally

Once starting to use git and uploading the project to a repository such as Github or GitLab, here we can add instructions on how to clone the package (if one has access to it).

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:leslieknope/raccoons.git
```

## How to prepare your R for the analyses

It's good practice to assume not everyone has the same R environment and set of packages installed locally. Here we can provide a ready made list of packages our project/package depends on.

Before installing our package, please copy-paste the following in your R console.

```
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'here', 'wesanderson', 'magrittr', 'rmarkdown', 'pkgdown', 'knitr'))
```
