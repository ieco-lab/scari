# Overview

This vignette will provide instructions to retrieve *Lycorma delicatula* (SLF) presence records for the future creation of MaxEnt models. MaxEnt is a presence-only modeling software, and so it does not require recorded absence data to predict the suitable area for SLF. Four categories of data sources will be used in this analysis: [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), [lydemapR](https://github.com/ieco-lab/lydemapr), various pieces of peer-reviewed literature, and natural history notes. These data will then be tidied, spatially thinned and compiled into a single `.csv` file of SLF presence records that can be loaded into MaxEnt java or MaxEnt for R (see the [dismo package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/index.html)).

The first step will be to retrieve data from `GBIF` and `lydemapr`. `GBIF` is an open-access platform for biodiversity data that gathers from various databases and citizen science platforms. Data from this source represents globally distributed presences of SLF. The [lyde()] function within the `Lydemapr` package gives access to over 650,000 SLF presence records within the United States, largely obtained from biological field surveys by various state and federal departments of agriculture. 

These data will need to be cleaned and tidied during this step. To get to this tidy dataset, the data will be checked for inconsistent and false records. The data will also be spatially thinned so that points are no less than 1km (the resolution of the climate data, 30 arcseconds) to eliminate the effects of sampling bias.

The second step will be to combine these records with data gathered from peer-reviewed literature and from natural history notes. A majority of these records are from established populations of SLF within China, South Korea and southeast Asia. These records are especially important because China and southeast Asia represent the native range for SLF, and there is very little data on the extent of its native range. These records are also important because MaxEnt correlates presence records with the local climate; thus, if there is very little characterization of the native range for this species, it is unlikely that models for SLF will make realistic predictions for its potential niche elsewhere.

The final step of this analysis will be to organize the different datasets into a single `.csv` file that can be loaded into MaxEnt. MaxEnt requires that input datasets contain only 3 columns, in this order: `species` (the scientific name of the species), `x` (longitude), and `y` (latitude). Lastly, the data will go through a second round of spatial thinning now that the datasets have been joined. 

Note, many of these chunks require high memory allocation or simply take a long time to run. The chunks that use `humboldt::humboldt.occ.rarefy()` for spatial thinning will take a very long time to run. The chunks that use `spThin::thin()` and that use `spocc::occ()` require a high memory allocation.  

# Setup

First, I will load in the necessary packages.

```{r load necesssary packages, echo = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)  #data manipulation

library(here) #making directory pathways easier on different instances
here()
# here() is set at the root folder of this package

library(devtools) # installing packages not from CRAN
# devtools::install_github("ieco-lab/lydemapr", build_vignettes = FALSE)
library(lydemapr) # field survey data for SLF
library(taxize) # get taxonomic ids
library(spocc) #query gbif and format as a dataframe

library(spThin) # spatial thinning of points
# install_github("jasonleebrown/humboldt")
library(humboldt) # spatial thinning of points
# remotes::install_github("ropensci/scrubr")
library(scrubr) #clean records for gbif data

library(patchwork) #nice plots
library(knitr) # nice rmd tables

```

Most of this compendium and its functions are built on the `tidyverse` language. The `here` package starts file pathing from the root folder of my `slfSpread` package, allowing easier sharing. The `spocc` package will be used to query records from `GBIF`, while the `lydemapr` package will be used to retrieve field survey data in the United States. `humboldt` makes for easy spatial thinning of points, while `spThin` is more thorough and evocative for thinning (both will be used). Package `taxize` will allow the retrieval of taxonomic IDs within `GBIF`. Lastly, `scrubr` allows for easier cleaning of presence records.

# 1. Retrieve data from GBIF and lydemapR and tidy

## 1.1- GBIF

I will begin by retrieving `GBIF` records.

```{r get SLF gbif taxa ID}

# get species ID from gbif database
ids <- taxize::get_ids(sci_com = "Lycorma delicatula", db = "gbif")

```

### Retrieve and save records

The retrieved ID is 5157899. This matches the ID for the [SLF repository](https://www.gbif.org/species/5157899) on GBIF.

Next, retrieve `GBIF` records using `spocc::occ()`. Before this, we will look up the helpfile for `rgbif::occ_data()` for specific settings for the `gbifopts` command within `spocc::occ()`. Specifically, I will be narrowing my search using the following options, which are direct mirrors of the filters available on the `GBIF` data portal:

* hasCoordinate: limit records to only those with coordinate data
* year: we will retrieve records between 1981 and 2023. 1981 was chosen as the earliest date because it corresponds with the earliest climate data available. 
* occurrenceStatus: set to only presences, because absence data is not needed
* basisOfRecord: here we include everything except fossil records, to ensure that records are within the target time period.
* hasGeospatialIssue: exclude any records with an issue in the coordinate data

Note: Simply change the `FALSE` within the `if()` statement to `TRUE` to run a chunk.

```{r retrieve SLF records from GBIF}

if(FALSE) {

  slf_gbif <- spocc::occ(ids = ids[[1]], # search by ID, not species name
                         from = 'gbif', 
                         limit = 1e5, # gbif limits number of queries to this
                         has_coords = TRUE, # only those with attached coordinate data
                         throw_warnings = TRUE,
                         # list of commands to pass to rgbif::occ_data()
                         gbifopts = list(
                           occurrenceStatus = "PRESENT",
                           # all records except fossil records
                           basisOfRecord = c("HUMAN_OBSERVATION", "MATERIAL_CITATION", "MATERIAL_SAMPLE", "LIVING_SPECIMEN", "MACHINE_OBSERVATION", "OBSERVATION", "PRESERVED_SPECIMEN", "OCCURRENCE"),
                           hasGeospatialIssue = FALSE,
                           year = "1981, 2023"
                         ))
  
}

``` 

The returned file is an `occdat` file, which has an element for all seven databases that the `spocc` package has access to. We want to isolate the raw data request from only `GBIF` and then save that as a `.csv` file. We also want to convert this data object into a data frame and save that as a separate `.csv`. We will also be doing some tidying to select only the `GBIF` points in the native range (this is the easiest way to get rid of unreliable points in the USA, which will be replaced with much more reliable points from the `lydemapr` package).

```{r save raw query and data}
  
if(FALSE) {
  
  # tibble raw queries
  slf_gbif_final <- as_tibble(slf_gbif$gbif$data$`5157899`)
  
  # select only countries in southeast Asia
  slf_gbif_final <- slf_gbif_final %>%
    filter(countryCode != "US")
  
  # save raw queries with date stamp as current date
  write_csv(x = slf_gbif_final, 
            file = file.path(here(), "data-raw", paste0("slf_gbif_", format(Sys.Date(), "%Y-%m-%d"), ".csv")))
    
  # object with key and country code to join to below object
  slf_gbif_final_key <- slf_gbif_final %>%
    select(key, countryCode)
  
  # convert occ data to dataframe
  slf_gbif_coords1 <- spocc::occ2df(slf_gbif) %>%
    left_join(., slf_gbif_final_key, by = "key") %>%
    filter(!is.na(countryCode),
           countryCode != "US") %>%
    dplyr::select(!countryCode)
    
  # save coords as-is
  write_csv(x = slf_gbif_coords1, 
            file = file.path(
              here(), "data-raw", 
              paste0("slf_gbif_raw_coords_", format(Sys.Date(), "%Y-%m-%d"), ".csv"))
            )

}

```

The raw pull from GBIF brought in 17,339 total records of SLF. The raw query and the raw coordinates were saved to the `data-raw` folder. I will read in the coordinate data that was just saved in preparation for data tidying. 

```{r read in raw data}

slf_gbif_coords1 <- read_csv(file = file.path(here(), "data-raw", "slf_gbif_raw_coords_2023-08-24.csv"))

```

### Coordinate veracity

First, we want to check the coordinate veracity using the `scrubr` package. This will check for unlikely, impossible or incomplete coordinate data. 

```{r coordinate veracity}

slf_gbif_coords1 <- slf_gbif_coords1 %>%
  coord_incomplete() %>%
  coord_impossible() %>%
  coord_unlikely()

```

Next, I will remove known erroneous points manually. We will also check for any alternative species names (MaxEnt will read each name as a different species, so the naming needs to be consistent). 

```{r remove known errors and tidy}

# remove incorrect points manually
slf_gbif_coords1 <- slf_gbif_coords1 %>%
  filter(key != "2860187641") %>% #rm OR---lat, lon:(43.63691, -121.85569)
  filter(key != "2862292948") %>% #rm NE---lat, lon:(42.50641,-101.01562)
  filter(key != "2864687343") %>% #rm DE---lat, lon:(37.91855, -75.14999)
  filter(!key %in% c("2856537682", "2851117559")) #rm MA---lat, lon:(42.20994, -71.18331)

# check species name
unique(slf_gbif_coords1$name)

# there is only one naming convention

# rename species name
slf_gbif_coords1$name <- "Lycorma delicatula"

```

Next, we will use `humboldt::humboldt.occ.rarefy` and `scrubr::dedup` to spatially thin the occurrence data. The `Humboldt` package was chosen to perform the initial thinning because it preserves non-coordinate data in its output. So, we can save a spatially thinned version of the data with other information (such as unique keys or dates) that might be useful later.

In `humboldt::humboldt.occ.rarefy`, The data will be rarefied to 1km over 10 passes. This will be done once more on the final dataset. Spatial thinning should reduce autocorrelation and sampling bias. I have programmed this function to rarefy at 1km, which is the resolution of the climate data we will use from `CHELSA` (30 arc-seconds, roughly 1km at the equator). This way, no more than one occurrence will be left per grid cell.

```{r spatial thinning}

if(TRUE) {

  slf_gbif_coords2 <- humboldt::humboldt.occ.rarefy(in.pts = slf_gbif_coords1, 
                                                    colxy = 2:3, # coordinate columns
                                                    rarefy.dist = 1, 
                                                    rarefy.units = "km", 
                                                    run.silent.rar = F) # display progress bars

}

```

Spatial thinning left 5888 of 17,339 observations, so it is apparent that the spatial thinning was needed. On the run without records in N. America, it left 733 of 1200 observations. Finally, we will de-duplicate the data.

```{r de-duplicate}

slf_gbif_coords3 <- slf_gbif_coords2 %>%
  scrubr::dedup(how = "one", tolerance = 0.99) # how = one means that one record of 2 will be kept if a duplicate is detected

```

We will save the results of the cleaning we just performed so they can be referenced or called later in our analysis. Later in this vignette, we will be combining these records with those from other data sources into a final dataset that is prepared for MaxEnt.

```{r save cleaned data}

write_csv(slf_gbif_coords3, file = file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", "slf_gbif_cleaned_coords_v3.csv"))

# also save as a .rda file
save(slf_gbif_coords3, file = file.path(here(), "data", "slf_gbif_cleaned_coords_v3.rda"))

```

## 1.2- LydemapR

### Retrieve and save lydemapR records

Next, we will retrieve data from the lydemapR package and save it as a `.csv`. I will repeat the spatial thinning and cleaning process outlined above.  

```{r retrieve lydemapR data and save raw pull}

if(FALSE) {

  slf_lyde <- lydemapr::lyde
  
  write_csv(x = slf_lyde, 
            file = file.path(here(), "data-raw", paste0("slf_lyde_raw_coords_", format(Sys.Date(), "%Y-%m-%d"), ".csv")))

}

```

The raw dataset is composed of over 658,000 records of SLF in the USA alone. Most of these records are concentrated in the mid-atlantic region where the invasion front is progressing. This dataset will also need a run of spatial thinning. First, we will need to narrow these records to fit our needs. At the time of writing this, I am only interested in records that were collected during field surveys, but this can be tuned to the needs of the analysis. So, I will set the collection method equal to the value of "field_survey/management". Obviously, I am also interested in presence records only. Lastly, I will pull records only from areas where SLF have established a population. LydemapR defines an established population as either 2+ adults or the presence of 1 egg mass. 

```{r select only desired records}

# read in data
slf_lyde <- read_csv(file = file.path(here(), "data-raw", "slf_lyde_raw_coords_2023-07-13.csv"))

# unique values for collection method
unique(slf_lyde$collection_method)

slf_lyde1 <- slf_lyde %>%
  filter(lyde_present == "TRUE", # only select presences
         collection_method == "field_survey/management", # collection method = "field_survey/management"
         lyde_established == "TRUE") %>% # only select areas records that are from established populations
  # add species column
  mutate(species = "Lycorma delicatula")

```

The data that fit our needs are about 26,000 records total.

### Coordinate veracity

Here we will run through the same data cleaning process that we performed for the `GBIF` data.

```{r coordinate veracity}

slf_lyde1 <- slf_lyde1 %>%
  coord_incomplete() %>%
  coord_impossible() %>%
  coord_unlikely()

```

```{r spatial thinning}

if(FALSE) {

  slf_lyde2 <- humboldt::humboldt.occ.rarefy(in.pts = slf_lyde1, 
                                             colxy = 4:5, # coordinate columns
                                             rarefy.dist = 1, 
                                             rarefy.units = "km", 
                                             run.silent.rar = F) # display progress bars

}

```

Spatial thinning for the `lyde` dataset left 3578 points out of the 26,000 points that fit our needs.

```{r de-duplicate and remove known errors}

slf_lyde3 <- slf_lyde2 %>%
  scrubr::dedup(how = "one", tolerance = 0.99)

```

```{r save cleaned data}

write_csv(slf_lyde3, file = file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", "slf_lyde_cleaned_coords_v1.csv"))

# also save as a .rda file
save(slf_lyde3, file = file.path(here(), "data", "slf_lyde_cleaned_coords_v1.rda"))

```

## 1.3- Visualize SLF distributions

We want to visualize the difference between the raw coordinates that were pulled from GBIF and the cleaned, spatially thinned version. This is to ensure proper geospatial coverage and the success of the spatial thinning runs. 

```{r visualize raw and thinned GBIF records}

# raw data
gbif_raw <- read_csv(file = file.path(here(), "data-raw", "slf_gbif_raw_coords_2023-07-12.csv"))

# thinned data
gbif_thinned <- read_csv(file = file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", "slf_gbif_cleaned_coords_v2.csv"))

# plot world map
map_gbif_thinned <- ggplot() +
  # the second line is a basemap from ggplot2
  geom_polygon(data = map_data('world'), aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "black", lwd = 0.15) +
  geom_point(data = gbif_raw, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "blue", size = 2) +
  geom_point(data = gbif_thinned, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "red", shape = 2) +
  coord_quickmap(xlim = c(-164.5, 163.5), ylim = c(-55, 85)) +
  ggtitle("SLF GBIF records- \n raw (blue) vs thinned (red)") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw()

# plot map of NAmerica
map_gbif_thinned_NAmerica <- ggplot() +
  # the second line is a basemap from ggplot2
  geom_polygon(data = map_data('world'), aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "black", lwd = 0.15) +
  geom_point(data = gbif_raw, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "blue", size = 2) +
  geom_point(data = gbif_thinned, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "red", shape = 2) +
  coord_quickmap(xlim = c(-133.593750, -52.294922), ylim = c(25.085599, 55.304138)) +
  ggtitle("SLF GBIF records- \n raw (blue) vs thinned (red)") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw()
  
# patchwork display of plots
map_gbif_thinned + map_gbif_thinned_NAmerica +
  plot_layout(ncol = 2)

```

From the mapping, it seems that the spatial thinning reduced the GBIF records, while preserving the same spatial extent. We also zoom in on the invaded range, and indeed every blue point is paired with at least 1 red point. So, our goal was met! We will do the same for the LydemapR data to ensure spatial thinning success.

```{r visualize raw and thinned lydemapr records}

# raw data
lyde_raw <- read_csv(file = file.path(here(), "data-raw", "slf_lyde_raw_coords_2023-07-13.csv"))

# thinned data
lyde_thinned <- read_csv(file = file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", "slf_lyde_cleaned_coords_v1.csv"))

# plot map of NAmerica
map_lyde_thinned <- ggplot() +
  # this plots a basemap of the USA because data here are exclusively from the USA
  geom_polygon(data = map_data('state'), aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "black", lwd = 0.15) +
  geom_point(data = lyde_raw, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "blue", size = 2) +
  geom_point(data = lyde_thinned, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "red", shape = 2) +
  coord_quickmap(xlim = c(-133.593750, -52.294922), ylim = c(25.085599, 55.304138)) +
  ggtitle("SLF lydemapR records- \n raw (blue) vs thinned (red)") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw()
  
# include citizen science platforms
lyde_raw1 <- lyde_raw %>%
  filter(lyde_present == "TRUE", 
         lyde_established == "TRUE") %>% 
  mutate(species = "Lycorma delicatula")



# plot map including these records
map_lyde_allRecords <- ggplot() +
  # this plots a basemap of the USA because data here are exclusively from the USA
  geom_polygon(data = map_data('state'), aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "black", lwd = 0.15) +
  geom_point(data = lyde_raw1, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "blue", size = 2) +
  geom_point(data = lyde_thinned, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "red", shape = 2) +
  coord_quickmap(xlim = c(-133.593750, -52.294922), ylim = c(25.085599, 55.304138)) +
  ggtitle("SLF lydemapR records- \n raw (blue) vs thinned (red)") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw()

# patchwork display of plots
map_lyde_thinned + map_lyde_allRecords +
  plot_layout(ncol = 2)

```

The results of the spatial thinning aren't incredibly clear from the first plot. It seems that most of the spatial extent of the records was eliminated by either the data tidying or the spatial thinning (in the second case, this would be an issue). I believe this is likely due to our preference for records that represent established populations and presences and those obtained from biological surveys. If I am sacrificing spatial extent of the records by excluding records from citizen science platforms, I would rather have these included. So, I will produce a second plot including those records as the blue points.

The second plot reveals that by including those points from citizen science platforms, I am not gaining much spatial extent of the records. The only other choice would be to accept records that do not represent established populations, which would not make for rigorous data. So, I will keep the records as-is (only including biological survey data, which are more reliable data).

# 2. Combine records

## 2.1- SLF data from published sources

In this step, I will combine the records obtained from GBIF and LydemapR with data taken from the literature. I will begin by loading in records taken from the published literature. There are a total of 165 records from China, southeast Asia, Japan, SK and the USA. Most of these records were obtained from genetic studies and represent samples taken from established populations of SLF. Data is scarce for established populations of SLF within its native range (China and southeast Asia), so these records are especially important. These records were taken from both peer-reviewed literature and natural history notes:

```{r kable table of published literature}

# read in .csv of papers
slf_published_papers <- read_csv(file.path(here(), "data-raw", "slf_publishedOccurrenceRecords_papers.csv"))

# kable table
kable(x = slf_published_papers, format = "pipe")

```

```{r load in records from literature}

slf_published <- read_csv(file.path(here(), "data-raw", "slf_publishedOccurrenceRecords_v1.csv"))

```

```{r map of data from published sources}

map_published_Asia <- ggplot() +
  # this plots a basemap of the USA because data here are exclusively from the USA
  geom_polygon(data = map_data('world'), aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "black", lwd = 0.15) +
  geom_point(data = slf_published, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "red") +
  coord_quickmap(xlim = c(68.906250, 152.534180), ylim = c(8.928487, 45.920587)) +
  ggtitle("SLF data from published sources \n in China") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw()

map_published_NAmerica <- ggplot() +
  # this plots a basemap of the USA because data here are exclusively from the USA
  geom_polygon(data = map_data('world'), aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "black", lwd = 0.15) +
  geom_point(data = slf_published, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = "red") +
  coord_quickmap(xlim = c(-133.593750, -52.294922), ylim = c(25.085599, 55.304138)) +
  ggtitle("SLF data from published sources \n in N America") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw()

# bounding box coords found at: 
# http://bboxfinder.com/#0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000

# patchwork
map_published_Asia + map_published_NAmerica +
  plot_layout(ncol = 2)

```

The map above shows that the occurrence data from the literature provide good coverage of the native range that we might not otherwise get.

## 2.2- Tidy and join datasets

Now, I will load in the cleaned coordinates from GBIF and LydemapR that we produced earlier. The object names are the same as where we left off.

```{r load in GBIF and lyde data}

slf_gbif_coords3 <- read_csv(file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", "slf_gbif_cleaned_coords_v3.csv"))

slf_lyde3 <- read_csv(file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", "slf_lyde_cleaned_coords_v1.csv"))

```

First, I will tidy the data for joining. We will keep only the species names, coordinates and unique key ID. We will also add a column that states which data source each point is from.

```{r tidy data sources}

# tidy gbif data
slf_gbif_coords3 %<>%
  dplyr::select(name:latitude, key, prov) %>%
  rename("data_source" = "prov",
         "species" = "name")

# tidy lyde data
slf_lyde3 %<>%
  dplyr::select(species, longitude, latitude, pointID) %>%
  rename("key" = "pointID") %>%
  mutate(data_source = "lyde")
  
# published data
slf_published %<>%
  dplyr::select(name:key, publishingArticle) %>%
  rename("species" = "name",
         "data_source" = "publishingArticle")

# the publishing data source column needs to be tidied further. I will take out commas and substitute spaces for underscores
slf_published$data_source <- gsub(pattern = " ", replacement = "_", x = slf_published$data_source) 
slf_published$data_source <- gsub(pattern = ",", replacement = "", x = slf_published$data_source)

# Finally, use head() to check coltypes are the same
head(slf_lyde3)
head(slf_gbif_coords3)
head(slf_published)

# we see that the key column in the GBIF dataset is a double, while the key columns in the other 2 are characters. We will change this:
slf_gbif_coords3$key <-  as.character(slf_gbif_coords3$key)

head(slf_gbif_coords3)

# the conversion worked

```

# 3. Join datasets and final tidying

Now the data are in a format that is easier to join. We will join the data and save the cleaned coordinates. 

```{r join datasets}

slf_all_coords <- slf_gbif_coords3 %>%
  full_join(., slf_lyde3) %>%
  full_join(., slf_published)

```

```{r save joined dataset}

write_csv(x = slf_all_coords, file = file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", "slf_all_coords_v1.csv"))

```

## 3.1- Final spatial thinning

The last step of tidying these data is to perform a second round of spatial thinning. We need to do this again because after joining 3 different datasets together, some of the points may be within 1km of each other. We will still use `scrubr::dedup`, but this time we will ditch `Humboldt` and use `spThin::thin` to spatially thin the occurrence data. `spThin::thin` has a more refined process for spatial thinning and tools for analyzing the output. 

The data will be rarefied to 1km over 10 passes. This will be done once more on the final dataset. Spatial thinning should reduce autocorrelation and sampling bias. Again, we will thin to a minimum of 1km distance between points. The results of the run should return the thinned dataset and a text log file of the thinning run.

Both files will be written to the `vignettes-outputs` folder, which holds intermediate data objects that are not the final versions of the data. 

```{r load in data}

slf_all_coords <- read_csv(file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", "slf_all_coords_v1.csv"))

```


```{r spatial thinning}

if(TRUE) {

  slf_all_coords2 <- spThin::thin(loc.data = slf_all_coords, 
                              lat.col = "latitude", long.col = "longitude",
                              spec.col = "species",
                              thin.par = 1,
                              reps = 10, # number of passes
                              # line below returns a list of data frames with the locations were preserved
                              locs.thinned.list.return = TRUE, 
                              write.files = TRUE, # returns list of thinned data as a separate .csv file
                              # next, create a file that logs the thinning run, write the path to and name of the log file
                              write.log.file = TRUE, 
                              log.file = file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", paste0("slf_all_coords_cleaned_thinning_log_", format(Sys.Date(), "%Y-%m-%d"), ".txt")),
                              # finally, tell it where to write the new files and what to call the thinned dataset
                              out.dir = file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables"),
                              out.base = paste0("slf_all_coords_cleaned_", format(Sys.Date(), "%Y-%m-%d")),
                              verbose = TRUE # give details of run in the console
                              )

}

```

Basically, this function thins the data 10 different times and writes the rep that was able to retain the most data points to a .csv file. The resulting object is a list of the retained coordinates per run. These data could be examined closer if there was a large difference in the records kept per run or some other disparity. 

Now that the data have been thinned, we will use `spThin::plotThin` to plot the results of the run and check its quality. Note, we will be plotting the actual data points in step 1.3; this function shows whether 10 is the optimal number of reps to thin this dataset. It will plot the number of records retained vs the number of reps. 

```{r QC thinned data}

spThin::plotThin(thinned = slf_all_coords2)

```

It seems from plot 3 that 7824-7826 records were retained during almost half of the reps. However, this is not very different from the maximum, so we will keep the maximum. 

Now, lets load in the final thinned dataset for a final round of cleaning.

```{r read in thinned data}

slf_all_coords2 <- read_csv(file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", "slf_all_coords_cleaned_2023-08-24_thin1.csv"))

```

```{r de-duplicate}

slf_all_coords3 <- slf_all_coords2 %>%
  scrubr::dedup(how = "one", tolerance = 0.99) 

```

# 3.2- Save output for MaxEnt

We will finally convert the slf coordinates to the format that will be used by MaxEnt and save it. That is, the first column "species" must be the species name, the second column "x" must be the longitude, and the third column "y" must be the latitude.

```{r maxent conversion and save}

# rename columns
slf_all_coords3 <- slf_all_coords3 %>%
  rename("x" = "longitude",
         "y" = "latitude")

# save
write_csv(x = slf_all_coords3, file = file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", paste0("slf_all_final_coords_v1_", format(Sys.Date(), "%Y-%m"), ".csv")))

# also save as a .rda file
save(slf_all_coords3, file = file.path(here(), "data", paste0("slf_all_final_coords_v1_", format(Sys.Date(), "%Y-%m"), ".rda")))

```

```{r map all points}

slf_all_coords3 <- read_csv(file = file.path(here(), "vignette-outputs", "data-tables", "slf_all_final_coords_v1_2023-08.csv"))

 map_all <- ggplot() +
    geom_polygon(data = map_data('world'), aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "black", lwd = 0.15) +
    geom_point(data = slf_all_coords3, aes(x = x, y = y), color = "red", size = 2) +
    coord_quickmap(xlim = c(-164.5, 163.5), ylim = c(-55, 85)) +
    ggtitle("All SLF presences") +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_blank()) +
    theme_bw()

    coord_quickmap(xlim = c(-133.593750, -52.294922), ylim = c(25.085599, 55.304138)) +
    ggtitle("SLF presences N AMerica") +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_blank()) +
    theme_bw()
 
  map_all_Asia <- ggplot() +
    geom_polygon(data = map_data('world'), aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = NA, color = "black", lwd = 0.15) +
    geom_point(data = slf_all_coords3, aes(x = x, y = y), color = "red", size = 2) +
    coord_quickmap(xlim = c(68.906250, 152.534180), ylim = c(8.928487, 45.920587)) +
    ggtitle("SLF presences Asia") +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_blank()) +
    theme_bw()

  # patchwork
  map_all_NAmerica + map_all_Asia +
  plot_layout(ncol = 2)
  
```

From the map, we can see the final points that were selected. Now we can use these data for MaxEnt models!

# Appendix

## Manually remove points that MaxEnt threw errors for

If this next chunk is run, the compilation of the SLF data from section 2 will need to be re-run. This chunk was added to remove points from the tidied GBIF pull that Maxent was throwing errors for. IF points do not overlap the climate surface, Maxent will throw errors for them.

```{r remove maxent errors}
