This vignette contains extra analyses and figures to explore ideas that don't necessarily fit with the main flow of the `slfSpread` project (or have yet to find a spot). 

```{r load necesssary packages, echo = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

library(here) 
# here() is set at the root folder of this package

library(terra)

```

# Invasion stage preliminary predictions

I will create a map where I vaguely outline areas that I think are suitable for SLF. I will also create a map with circles around areas where SLF populations might be at certain invasion stages (ex. sink populations vs established populations).

```{r}

```
