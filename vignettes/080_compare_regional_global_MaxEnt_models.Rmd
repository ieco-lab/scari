# Overview

This vignette will compare the invaded region model for SLF, which was created in `050_run_easternUSA_MaxEnt_models.Rmd`, with the global version of this model, which was created in `070_run_global_historical_MaxEnt_model.Rmd`. First, I will compare these models using flexible AUC. Second, I will also project these models to N. America and compare the proportion of suitable area. Third, I will calculate suitabilitiy values for all SLF points and IVR regions. Finally, I will perform an invasion stage analysis following the methods of Gallien et.al, 2012. 

In step 1, I tested the best fit background data using SLF occurrences and climate data only from the SLF invaded range (the eastern half of the United States).
