I will ensemble the regional models I produced. Here are the steps for this process:

1. I will weight each model by its AUC value. 
2. I will weight each model by its level of extrapolation and thus our level of confidence in its predictions. This will be an inverse weight


```{r load necesssary packages, echo = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

library(here) 
# here() is set at the root folder of this package

# spatial data handling
library(terra)
library(raster)


```

```{r}

```
