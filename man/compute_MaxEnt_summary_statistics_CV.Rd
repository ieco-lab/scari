\title{Output summary statistics for a MaxEnt model ('SDMmodelCV' object)}
\usage{
compute_MaxEnt_summary_statistics_CV(
  model.obj,
  model.name = "MODEL",
  mypath,
  create.dir = FALSE,
  env.covar.obj,
  train.obj,
  trainFolds.obj,
  test.obj,
  plot.fun = "mean",
  plot.type = "cloglog",
  jk.test.type = "test"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model.obj}{A model object created by the package 'SDMtune', should be of
class 'SDMmodelCV'.}

\item{model.name}{Character. A string matching the name of the object set for
\code{model.obj}. Exclude unnecessary phrases, such as the "_model" ending.}

\item{mypath}{Character.A file path to the sub directory where the model
output will be stored. Should be used with the \code{\link[=file.path]{file.path()}} function
(i.e. with '/' instead of '\\'). If this sub directory does not already exist
and should be created by the function, set \code{create.dir} = TRUE. This will
create a folder from the last part of the filepath in \code{mypath}.}

\item{create.dir}{Logical. Should the last element of \code{mypath} create a sub
directory for the model output? If TRUE, the main folder will be created for
the model output. If FALSE (ie, the sub directory already exists), only the
"plots" folder within the model output sub directory will be created.}

\item{env.covar.obj}{A stack of rasters of environmental covariates. These
covariates are used to train and test the MaxEnt model, as well as to make
predictions. These should be the same covariates that you used to train the
model. This must a \code{SpatRaster} object created using \code{\link[terra:rast]{terra::rast()}}.}

\item{train.obj}{The main group of presence and background points used to
train the model. Should be a SWD object, created using the
\code{\link[SDMtune:prepareSWD]{SDMtune::prepareSWD()}} function.}

\item{trainFolds.obj}{A list of two matrices that specify the fold of the
training and testing points. This object is used to create k-fold partitions
from presence and background datasets to train a \code{SWDmodelCV} object. This is
created using the \code{\link[SDMtune:randomFolds]{SDMtune::randomFolds()}} function.}

\item{test.obj}{A withheld group of presence and background points used to
test the model after training. Should be a SWD object, created using the
\code{\link[SDMtune:prepareSWD]{SDMtune::prepareSWD()}} function.}

\item{plot.fun}{Character. Default is "mean". The function used to determine
the level of the other variables when creating the marginal curve. Can be one
of: \code{min}, \code{mean}, \code{median}, \code{max}, or \code{sd} (standard deviation).}

\item{plot.type}{Character. Default is "cloglog".The type of output
desired for the marginal and univariate response curves. Choices are "logistic"
and "cloglog".If both are used, must be concatenated in the form:
\code{c("logistic", "cloglog")}.}

\item{jk.test.type}{Character. Default is "test". When a jackknife test is
conducted, this specifies whether to conduct the test on the training or the
test dataset. Choices are one of both of "train" and "test". If both are used,
must be concatenated in the form: \code{c("train", "test")}.}
}
\value{
The output of this function includes the following:
\itemize{
\item training and test datasets used for the model
\item listed model parameters and suitability thresholds
\item K-folds and which samples were included per fold
\item variable contributions, permutation importance and SD
\item confusion matrices per iteration
\item jackknife tests for both training and testing data, per iteration
\item jackknife plots
\item AUC / TSS
\item ROC plots
\item marginal and univariate response curves
}
}
\description{
This function will create a directory for and save a MaxEnt model that was run
using the \code{SDMtune} R package. It will use the model to calculate a list of
summary statistics based on the test data and covariates given. See 'return'
for a list of summary statistics outputs.
}
\details{
The function requires the packages 'tidyverse', 'here', 'devtools', 'rJava', 'dismo', 'SDMtune', 'viridis', 'plotROC', 'cli', and 'terra'.
