\title{Calculate placement of point-wise suitability values on risk quadrant plot}
\usage{
calculate_risk_quadrant(suit.x, suit.y, thresh.x, thresh.y)
}
\arguments{
\item{suit.x}{Suitability values comprising the x-axis. Global-scale model is
usually placed along the x-axis.}

\item{suit.y}{Suitability values comprising the y-axis. Regional-scale ensemble
model is usually placed along the x-axis.}

\item{thresh.x}{The threshold for suitability accompanying the x-axis model
values.}

\item{thresh.y}{The threshold for suitability accompanying the y-axis model
values.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame. Values will be one of: "extreme", "high", "moderate",
or "low". These correspond with our interpretation of the risk quadrant plots we have created:
\itemize{
\item extreme risk = quadrant 4 (upper right)
\item high risk = quadrant 3 (upper left)
\item moderate risk = quadrant 2 (bottom right)
\item low risk = quadrant 1 (bottom left)
}
}
\description{
This function categorizes the risk of establishment by Lycorma
delicatula according to our risk quadrant framework, which is the intersection
between predictions made by the global and regional-scale models. It will return
which quadrant a suitability value will fall into on an xy-scatter.
}
\details{
#'The function requires the packages 'dplyr' and 'cli'.

Input data formats:
\itemize{
\item param "suit" = matrix of suitability values
\item param "thresh" = numeric
}

Input suitability data can be created using the function \code{predict_xy_suitability},
or extracted from a raster using \code{terra::extract()}, as needed.
}
\examples{

# I typically use it with dplyr::mutate() to create a new column in a data frame.

```R

IVR_locations_risk <- dplyr::mutate(IVR_locations_risk, risk_1995 = slfSpread::calculate_risk_quadrant(
 suit.x = IVR_locations_joined$xy_global_1995_rescaled,
 suit.y = IVR_locations_joined$xy_regional_ensemble_1995_rescaled,
 thresh.x = global_MTSS, # this threshold remains the same
 thresh.y = regional_ensemble_MTSS_1995
 ))

```
